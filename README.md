# patchcore-MVTech-anomaly-detection
- I have rearranged original patchcore codes (https://github.com/amazon-science/patchcore-inspection) in order to apply this State-of-the-Art approach more freely/lightly.
- Also I have tried to re-engineer it to make the model/approach applicable to edge device
  - **lighter feature extractor applicable edge device, preferring MobileNet** over WideResnet originally applied in patchcore. But some parameter tuning is required due to narrow channels of MobileNet.
  - **convert pytorch model to tflite model (8 bit model)** via onnix converter.
  - **the relevant scripts are found in folder**:
    - '00_convert_middle_layer_feature_extractor_pytorch_model_to_tflite'
- I researched, **in details step-by-step, how patchcore works**
  - see for scripts in folder '00_patchcore_details_check_step_by_step'
- When you need **data augmentation**
  - see (for some help) scripts in folder '00_data_preparation_with_image_processing'
- main driver scripts are in folder 'main'
- 'src' and 'src2' is almost totally from original patchcore codes.
